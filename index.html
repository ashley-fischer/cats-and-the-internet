    <strong>Grumpy Cat</strong>, a pet made famous through an image macro, on stage at VidCon 2014 Images and videos of domestic cats make up some of the most viewed content on the web, particularly image macros in the form of lolcats. ThoughtCatalog
    has described cats as the "unofficial mascot of the Internet".<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> The subject has attracted the attention of various scholars and critics, who have analysed why this form of low art has reached iconic status. Although it may
    be considered frivolous, cat-related internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture.<sup><sup>[2]</sup> </sup>Some argue that there is a depth and complexity to this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the
    positive psychological effects that pets have on their owners also holds true for cat images viewed online.<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup> Some individual cats, such as Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub, have achieved popularity online because of their unusual appearances
    and funny cat videos.
  </p>

  <h2 id="#history">
    <span>History &#128062;</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Humans have always had a close relationship with cats, and the animals have long been a subject of short films, including the early silent movies Boxing Cats (1894) and The Sick Kitten (1903).<sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>Harry Pointer (1822–1889) has
    been cited as the "progenitor of the shameless cat picture".<sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup> Cats have been shared via email since the internet's rise to prominence in the 1990s.<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> The first cat video on YouTube was uploaded in 2005
    by YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, who posted a video of his cat called "Pajamas and Nick Drake".<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> The following year, "Puppy vs Cat" became the first viral cat video; uploaded by a user called Sanchey (a.k.a. Michael Wienzek);<sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup>
    as of 2015 it had over 16 million views on YouTube.<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> In a Mashable article that explored the history of cat media on the Internet, the oldest entry was an ASCII art cat that originated on 2channel, and was a pictorial representation
    of the phrase "Please go away."<sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup>
  </p>


  <p>
    The New York Times described cat images as "that essential building block of the Internet".<sup>[9]</sup> In addition, 2,594,329 cat images had been manually annotated in flickr.com by users.<sup><sup>[10]</sup> </sup>An interesting phenomenon is
    that many photograph owners tag their house cats as "tiger".<sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Eric Nakagawa and Kari Unebasami started the website I Can Haz Cheezburger in 2007, where they shared funny pictures of cats. This site allowed users to create LOLcat memes by placing writing on top of pictures of their cats. This site now has more than
    100 million views per month and has "created a whole new form of internet speak".<sup>[6]</sup> In 2009, the humour site Urlesque deemed September 9 "A Day Without Cats Online", and had over 40 blogs and websites agree to "[ban] cats from their
    pages for at least 24 hours".<sup>[12]</sup> As of 2015, there are over 2 million cat videos on YouTube alone, and cats are one of the most searched keywords on the internet.<sup>[6]</sup> CNN estimated that in 2015 there could be around 6.5 billion
    cat pictures on the internet.<sup>[13]</sup> The internet has been described as a "virtual cat park, a social space for cat lovers in the same way that dog lovers congregate at a dog park".<sup>[14]</sup> The Daily Telegraph deemed Nyan Cat the most
    popular internet cat,<sup>[15]</sup> while NPR gave this title to Grumpy Cat.<sup>[16]</sup> The Daily Telegraph also deemed the best cat video on YouTube as "Surprised Kitty (Original)", which currently has over 75 million views.<sup>[17]</sup> Buzzfeed
    deemed Cattycake the most important cat of 2010.<sup>[18]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2015, an exhibition called "How Cats Took Over The Internet" opened at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York.<sup>[19]</sup> The exhibition "looks at the history of how they rose to internet fame, and why people like them so much".<sup>[6]</sup>    There is even a book entitled How to Make Your Cat an Internet Celebrity: A Guide to Financial Freedom.<sup>[20]</sup> The annual Internet Cat Video Festival celebrated and awards the Golden Kitty to cat videos.<sup>[21]</sup> According to Star Tribune,
    the festival's success is because "people realized that the cat video they'd chuckled over in the privacy of their homes was suddenly a thousand times funnier when there are thousands of other people around".<sup>[22]</sup> The Daily Telegraph had
    an entire article devoted to International Cat Day.<sup>[23]</sup> EMGN wrote an article entitled "21 Reasons Why Cats And The Internet Are A Match Made in Heaven".<sup>[24]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2015, there were more than 2 million cat videos on YouTube, with an average of 12,000 views each – a higher average than any other category of YouTube content.<sup>[25]</sup> Cats made up 16% of views in YouTube's "Pets & Animals" category, compared
    to dogs' 23%.<sup>[26]</sup> The YouTube video Cats vs. Zombies merged the two internet phenomena of cats and zombies.<sup>[27]</sup> Data from BuzzFeed and Tumblr has shown that dog videos have more views than those of cats, and less than 1% of posts
    on Reddit mention cats.<sup>[28]</sup> While dogs are searched for much more than cats, there is less content on the internet.<sup>[29]</sup> The Facebook page "Cats" has over 2 million likes while Dogs has over 6.5 million.<sup>[30]</sup> In an Internet
    tradition, The New York Times Archives Twitter account posts cat reporting throughout the history of the NYT.<sup>[31]</sup><sup>[32]</sup> The Japanese prefecture of Hiroshima launched an online Cat Street View, which showed the region from the perspective
    of a cat.<sup>[33]</sup><sup>[34]</sup>
  </p>


  <p>
    Abigail Tucker, author of The Lion in the Living Room, a history of domestic cats, has suggested that cats appeal particularly because they "remind us of own faces, and especially of our babies...<sup>[they're]</sup> strikingly human but also perpetually
    deadpan".<sup>[35]</sup><sup>[36]</sup>

  <p>
    Jason Eppink, curator of the Museum of the Moving Image's show How Cats Took Over the Internet, has noted the "outsized role" of cats on the Internet.<sup>[37]</sup> Wired magazine felt that the cuteness of cats was "too simplistic" an explanation
    of their popularity online.<sup>[28]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    A scientific survey done found that the participants were more happy after watching cat videos.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[38]</sup> The researcher behind the survey explained "If we want to better understand the effects the Internet may have on us as individuals
    and on society, then researchers can't ignore Internet cats anymore"<sup>[39]</sup> and "consumption of online cat-related media deserves empirical attention".<sup>[40]</sup> The Huffington Post suggested that the videos were a form of procrastination,
    with most being watched while at work or ostensibly studying,<sup>[41]</sup> while IU Bloomington commented "<sup>[it]</sup> does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers' energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings".<sup>[42]</sup>    BusinessInsider argues "This falls in line with a body of research regarding the effects that animals have on people."<sup>[43]</sup> A 2015 study by Jessica Gall Myrick found that people were more than twice as likely to post a picture or video of
    a cat to the internet than they were to post a selfie.<sup>[25]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Maria Bustillos considers cat videos to be "the crystallisation of all that human beings love about cats", with their "natural beauty and majesty" being "just one tiny slip away from total humiliation", which Bustillos sees as a mirror of the human condition.<sup>[44]</sup>    When the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, was asked for an example of a popular use of the internet that he would never had predicted, he answered "Kittens".<sup>[45]</sup><sup>[46]</sup> A 2014 paper argues that cats' "unselfconsciousness"
    is rare in an age of hyper-surveillance, and cat photos appeal to people as it lets them imagine "the possibility of freedom from surveillance", while presenting the power of controlling that surveillance as unproblematic.<sup>[47]</sup> Time magazine
    felt that cat images tap into viewers nature as "secret voyeurs".<sup>[26]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cheezburger Network considers cats to be the "perfect canvas" for human emotion, as they have expressive facial and body aspects.<sup>[48]</sup> Mashable offered "cats' cuteness, non-cuteness, popularity among geeks, blank canvas qualities, personality
    issues, and the fact that dogs just don't have "it"" as possible explanations to cats' popularity on the internet.<sup>[49]</sup> A paper entitled ""I Can Haz Emoshuns?" – Understanding Anthropomorphosis of Cats among Internet Users" found that Tagpuss,
    an app that showed users cat images and asked them to choose their emotion "can be used to identify cat behaviours that lay-people find difficult to distinguish".<sup>[50]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Jason Eppink, curator of the "How Cats Took Over the Internet" exhibition, explained: “People on the web are more likely to post a cat than another animal, because it sort of perpetuates itself. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. <sup>[sic]</sup>”<sup>[32]</sup><sup>[51]</sup>    Jason Kottke considers cats to be "easier to objectify" and therefore "easier to make fun of".<sup>[52]</sup> Journalist Jack Shepherd suggested that cats were more popular than dogs because dogs were "trying too hard", and humorous behavior in a
    dog would be seen as a bid for validation. Shepherd sees cats' behavior as being "cool, and effortless, and devoid of any concern about what you might think about it. It is art for art's sake".<sup>[53]</sup>
  </p>


  <p>
    Cats have historically been associated with magic, and have been revered by various human cultures, the ancient Egyptians worshipping them as gods and the creatures being feared as demons in ancient Japan,<sup>[13]</sup> such as the bakeneko. Vogue
    magazine has suggested that the popularity of cats on the internet is culturally-specific, being popular in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. Other nations favor different animals online, Ugandans sharing images of goats and chickens, Mexicans
    preferring llamas, and Chinese internet users sharing images of the river crab and grass-mud horse due to double-meanings of their names allowing them to "subvert government Internet censors".<sup>[54]</sup>
